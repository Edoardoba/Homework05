# Study on Wikipedia HyperLinks
As were asked in the [HomeWork Page](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/tree/master/Homework_5) we had to explore and analyze a dataset containing information related to articles in Wikipedia. We had three different files to import and to work with:


* [Wikicat Hyperlinks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghPJ4g6XMCUDFQ2JPqAVveLyytG8gBfL/view):  Every row is an edge, the two elements are the nodes (source and destination).

* [wiki-topcats-categories.txt.gz](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html): List with every category with every article linked to it.

* [wiki-topcats-page-names.txt.gz](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html): List with the name of the pages.

After importing the data we proceeded with the tasks we were asked to fulfill.

We have written a single working python notebook file with all the code we used in it. You can find detailed explanation in there that will explain to you the choices we have made. We tried to use, as much as we could, methods similar to the ones we have used in the labs(i.e. We used the networkX package).

WRITE HERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMEROSITY WE DECIDED TO USE
